Practicing some front end concepts 

To go a little more in depth... I'll be creating a nice looking static page! I'm doing this to "flex" (no pun intended) some of the skills I've been learning over these past few days. I've always been a little scared of CSS, but I beleive I'm on my way to conquering this demon. By the end of this project I will be good at using Flex properties to build a nice static page :3
